# Sudoku
sudoku solver in ruby

following this invaluable article https://dlbeer.co.nz/articles/sudoku.html

got it to a reasonable performance level

# TODO
* Enable YJIT
* svelte frontend

# IDEAS
* rewrite it in javascript/something faster w/ wasm (rust :eyes:)
* constraint solver? prolog??
* would much rather a scheme or sbcl rewrite tho
