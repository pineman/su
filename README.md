# Sudoku
sudoku solver in ruby

following this invaluable article https://dlbeer.co.nz/articles/sudoku.html

got it to a reasonable performance level

horribly stitched together with wasm (wasi polyfill) at https://pineman.github.io/su/su.html

eventually this will have to be its own backend/frontend project hosted at fly or something

unless I rewrite it in javascript/something faster w/ wasm (rust :eyes:)

woudl much rather a scheme or sbcl rewrite tho
